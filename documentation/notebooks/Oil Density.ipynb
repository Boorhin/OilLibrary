    "The density of a substance is a fairly important piece of information to know in regards to oil spill response.  If an oil is released into a body of water, its relative density to that body of water will indicate whether the oil will float on top of the water surface, or whether it will gradually sink below the surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two general properties in an oil record that indicate its initial density.  Those are the oils **API** gravity, and its **measured density**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An oil's API gravity is a measure of how heavy or light it is compared to water, as defined by the\n",
    "**A**merican **P**etroleum **I**nstitute. As such it is essentially a different unit for the density of the oil at standard temperature (and pressure). If there is a measured density (at 15C) and an API in a given record, the values should match, or there is an error in the record.\n",
