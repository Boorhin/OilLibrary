So a maximum pour point is measured for the case in which the oil has stayed at a constant temperature for awhile, and a minimum pour point value is often measured for the case that the oil was recently heated, breaking down the crystalline structures.  The \"freshly heated\" pour point is expected to be lower than the pour point of older oil kept in a constant temperature.\n",
